## ⚙️ How It Works

The project begins by loading a dataset containing email messages labeled as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**. The text data is then preprocessed by converting all characters to lowercase, removing punctuation and stopwords, and tokenizing the text into meaningful words. After preprocessing, feature extraction techniques such as **Bag of Words** or **TF-IDF Vectorization** are applied to convert the text into numerical representations. These features are used to train a machine learning model, which is later evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy score** and a **classification report**.

## 📊 Results

The model is able to successfully classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**, achieving good accuracy using standard natural language processing techniques. Detailed performance metrics and evaluation results can be found within the notebook.

## 💡 Future Improvements

Future enhancements may include implementing more advanced machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks, improving text preprocessing techniques, deploying the model as a web application, and enabling real-time email classification.
